# Interval Pattern

## What are Interval Problems?
Interval problems involve dealing with ranges or periods defined by a start and end point. These problems typically require manipulating, analyzing, or organizing these intervals in various ways. An interval is usually represented as a pair of numbers [start, end].

## Real-World Applications

### 1. Calendar/Scheduling Systems
- Meeting room scheduling
- Flight booking systems
- Resource allocation
- Event planning and coordination
- Doctor's appointments

### 2. Resource Management
- CPU task scheduling
- Network bandwidth allocation
- Hotel room reservations
- Parking lot management
- Equipment rental systems

### 3. Project Management
- Project timeline planning
- Task dependency management
- Resource availability tracking
- Sprint planning in Agile
- Construction project scheduling

### 4. Data Processing
- Time series data analysis
- Log file processing
- Network packet analysis
- Database transaction management
- Backup scheduling

## Common Operations
1. **Merging Intervals**: Combining overlapping intervals
2. **Interval Intersection**: Finding common time periods
3. **Interval Coverage**: Determining if intervals cover a range
4. **Conflict Detection**: Finding overlapping intervals
5. **Interval Insertion**: Adding new intervals while maintaining order

## Key Techniques
1. Sorting intervals by start/end times
2. Using min/max heaps for dynamic interval tracking
3. Line sweep algorithms
4. Two-pointer approaches
5. Greedy algorithms

## Common Challenges
- Handling overlapping intervals
- Dealing with interval conflicts
- Optimizing resource allocation
- Finding gaps between intervals
- Maintaining efficient data structures for interval operations

## Time Complexity Considerations
Most interval problems require sorting as a first step, leading to at least O(n log n) time complexity. However, the actual operations on intervals can often be performed in O(n) time after sorting.
