## Backtracking: The Art of Exploring All Possibilities
>"Backtracking is like being a detective who methodically explores every possible clue to solve a mystery. It's an algorithmic technique that systematically searches through all potential combinations to find the perfect solution."

## How to Spot a Backtracking Problem üîç
1. **The Combination Challenge**: You're dealing with puzzles involving combinations, permutations, or multiple possible solutions. Think of it like creating different playlists from your favorite songs - there are many valid ways to arrange them!

2. **The Recursive Dance**: Your solution needs both iteration and recursion working together in perfect harmony. Like a nested loop within a recursive function, where each iteration opens up new possibilities:

```
void someRecursiveFunction(int x, int y){
    /* do something... */
    for(int i = 0; i < y; i++){
        /* do something in the for loop... */
        // call someRecursiveFunction with updated parameters
        someRecursiveFunction(x, y+i);
    }
    /* do something else... */
}
```

3. **The Base Case**: You need to identify the point where you've found a valid solution. This is where you'll stop the recursion and return the result.

Yes, this is a backtracking problem!

```java
class Solution {
    /* Declare private data structures: */
    private ArrayList<Integer> solutions;
    public List<List<Integer>> permute(int[] nums) {
        // declare private data structures
        solutions = new ArrayList<>();
        // call backtrack
        backtrack(param1, param2);
        // return results
        return this.results;
    }

    private void backtrack(int param1, int param2){
        // handle base case!
        if(BaseCase qualified){
            // Add current result to the solution collection
            solutions.add(param2)
            return;
        }

        for(int i = 0; i< param1; i++){
            // 1. Handle edge case
            if(count[i] == 0) continue;
            // 2. Prepare a possible solution using some variable
            result.set(level, nums[i]);
            // 3. Remove used variable in step 2
            count[i]--;
            // 4. Call backtrack recursively
            backtrack(param1, param2+1);
            // 5. Add used variable in step 2 and 4 back to the set
            count[i]++;
        }
    }
}
```
