## Problem Description

Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/

Given a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

For example:
Given binary tree [3, 9, 20, null, null, 15, 7],

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

return its zigzag level order traversal as: [[3], [20, 9], [15, 7]].

## Solution

### High level strategy
Our strategy to solve this problem will be to conduct a breadth-first search. However, unlike an ordinary breadth-first search, we will only traverse from the left to right on even levels (including zero), and from the right to left on odd levels. The time and space complexity of this solution is **O(n)**.

```
    3   level 0; traverse from left to right [3]
   / \
  9  20   level 1; traverse from right to left [20, 9]
    /  \
   15   7   level 2; traverse from left to right [15, 7]
```

### Code
```javascript
const zigzagLevelOrder = (root) => {
    let result = [];
    
    let recurse = (node, level) => {
        if (node === null) return;
        if (!result[level]) {
            result[level] = [];
        }
        
        if (level % 2 === 0) {
            result[level].push(node.val); // left to right traversal is implemented with the push method
        } else {
            result[level].unshift(node.val); // right to left traversal is implemented with the unshift method
        }
        
        recurse(node.left, level + 1);
        recurse(node.right, level + 1);
    };
    
    
    recurse(root, 0);
    return result;
};
```
