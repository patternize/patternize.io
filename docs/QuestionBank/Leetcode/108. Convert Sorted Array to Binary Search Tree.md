## Problem Description

Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/

Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST. A height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

For example: 
Given the sorted array: [-10, -3, 0, 5, 9], return the following tree:
```
        0
       / \
     -3   9
     /   /
   -10  5
```

## Solution

### High level strategy
To ensure that both sides of the tree has an equal amount of nodes, and to maintain the binary search tree invariant, we must always choose the middle element of the input array as our root node. After setting the root node of the tree, we split the input array in two sub-arrays to repeat the aforementioned logic. The middle element of every sub-array will always be the root node of every subtree. The time and space complexity of this solution are both **O(n)**.

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 **/

const sortedArrayToBST = (nums) => {

    let helper = (left, right) => {
        if (left > right) return null;

        let index = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        let root = new TreeNode(nums[index]);
        root.left = helper(left, index - 1);
        root.right = helpter(index + 1, right);

        return root;
    };

    return helper(0, nums.length - 1);
}
```
