## Problem Description

Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/

Given a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.

For example:
Given binary tree [1, 2, 3, null, 6, null, 4, null, null, 5],

```
    1   <----- 1
   / \
  2   3     <----- 3
   \   \
    6   4     <----- 4
   /
  5     <----- 5
```

return [1, 3, 4, 5].

## Solution

### High level strategy
Our strategy to solve this problem is to conduct a breadth-first search. On each level, we traverse from the left to right, replacing the previously traversed nodes with the right-most node. The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**.

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 **/

const rightSideView = (root) => {
    let result = [];

    let recurse = (node, level) => {
        if (node === null) return;
        result[level] = node.val;
        recurse(node.left, level + 1);
        recurse(node.right, level + 1);
    };

    recurse(root, 0);
    return result;
};
```
