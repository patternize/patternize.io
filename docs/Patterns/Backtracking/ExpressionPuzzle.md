# ABC + ABC = DEA
Assign values to characters in an express so that it is valid:

Ex.1:

```
For expression "ABC" + "ABC" = "DEA"
The assignment {'A': 2, 'B': 3, 'C': 1, 'D': 4, 'E': 6} will make the expression true:
if we subsitute the numbers to their according letters:
the expression becomes 231  +  231  =  462 (which is valid)
```

Ex.2:

```
For expression "AA" + "B" = "CDE"
The assignment {'A':9, 'B': 3, 'C': 1, 'D': 0, 'E': 2} will make the expression true:
if we subsitute the numbers to their according letters:
the expression becomes 99  +  3  =  102 (which is valid)
```
